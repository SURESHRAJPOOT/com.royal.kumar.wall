<br><br>
Coraciidae is a family of Old World birds known as rollers because of the aerial acrobatics some of these birds perform during courtship or territorial flights.
<br><br>
<b>Scientific name: </b>Coraciidae
<br><br>
<b>Length:</b> Blue-bellied roller: 28 – 30 cm 
<br><br>
<b>Rank:</b> Family
<br><br>
<b>Higher classification:</b> Coraciiformes
<br><br>
<b>Mass:</b> European roller: 150 g, Indian roller: 160 g, Lilac-breasted roller: 110 g, Blue-bellied roller: 110 – 150 g
<br><br>
Roller, any of about 12 species of Old World birds constituting the family Coraciidae (order Coraciiformes), named for the dives and somersaults they perform during the display flights in courtship. 
<br><br>

The family is sometimes considered to include the ground rollers and cuckoo rollers. Rollers inhabit warm regions from Europe and Africa to Australia.
<br><br>

Ranging in length from 25 to 32 cm (10 to 13 inches), rollers look like stocky, short-legged jays and are predominately blue or violet in colour. 
<br><br>
They gather in noisy flocks to feed on locusts, flying ants, and lizards. Most nest in tree holes; some burrow in termite nests.
The 30-centimetre- (12-inch-) long common roller (Coracias garrulus), found from southern Europe to western Asia, has vivid blue wings with black borders. See also cuckoo roller; ground roller.

<br>
<font><h4>Distribution and habitat</h4></font>  
<br>
The European roller is a bird of warmer regions. The nominate subspecies breeds in northern Africa from Morocco to Tunisia, in southern and east-central Europe, and eastwards through northwestern Iran to southwestern Siberia. 
<br><br>

The subspecies C. g. semenowi breeds from Iraq and southern Iran east through Kashmir and southern Kazakhstan to Xinjiang. The European range was formerly more extensive, but there has been a long-term decline in the north and west, with extinction as a nesting bird in Sweden and Germany. 
<br><br>

The European roller is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa south of the Sahara in two distinct regions, from Senegal east to Cameroon and from Ethiopia west (with observations in the Degua Tembien mountains) to Congo and south to South Africa.
<br><br>

Some populations migrate to Africa through India. A collision with an aircraft over the Arabian Sea has been recorded.
<br><br>

<font><h4>Migration</h4></font>  
<br>
The advent of sufficiently lightweight tracking technology has facilitated several recent studies of roller migration, providing new information on the non-breeding sites used by rollers from different breeding populations. 
<br><br>

Individuals from south-west European populations migrate to south-west Africa (Angola, Namibia, Botswana), with French and north-Spanish birds taking a direct southerly route across the Sahara and Portuguese and south-Spanish taking a more westerly route around the west African coast. 
<br><br>

Rollers from eastern European populations also spend the winter period in southern Africa, but further east in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana. 
<br><br>

The Sahel savannah region immediately south of the Sahara Desert (particularly the area around Lake Chad) appears to be important for rollers from many populations as an autumn re-fuelling site, and Latvian and other north and north-eastern populations migrate northwards via the Arabian Peninsula in spring. 
<br><br>

Individuals from different breeding populations use distinct but overlapping winter sites; there is a good correlation between the longitude of individual breeding and non-breeding sites, suggesting parallel migration. 
<br><br>

In the east, the northernmost breeders (from Latvia) tend to winter south of the southernmost breeders (from Cyprus) - this suggests a pattern of 'leap-frog' migration.
